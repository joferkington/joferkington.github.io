About Me
========

I'm a geologist by training, but these days do mostly software. I have strange
hobbies, and there isn't that much to know about me. I do have a cute doggo,
though!

Forgive the Tigers hat. I'm mostly an Astros fan (yeah, I know).

I do a lot of random exploring and I'm overly fond of fancy picnics.
